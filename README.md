# Smart Contracts by Federico D.

## [These smart contracts are written in the Solidity language, and are deployable on the Ethereum Blockchain.]

### Ever wondered what is the true innovation of Ethereum compared to Bitcoin?

Well, Ethereum Nodes use a Virtual Machine that supports a Turing-Complete language, thus enabling users to write complex logic in the form of smart contracts. Smart Contracts can accomplish many many tasks in a very transparent and verifiable way.

It is a real power! But on the flipside I really think that enabling a Turing complete language also opens up the attack surfact and the possibility of software vulnerabilities and exploits. The Bitcoin blockchain is Turing INcomplete, and has a stack-based limited language making its Virtual Machine a lot more secure and infallible in my opinon. But that is a whole discussion that I do not want to go into here :) .

I think investing some time in learning Solidity will open up my mind and expose me to concepts that have never been on this earth before.
